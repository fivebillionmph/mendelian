Experiment
	# layout will include several tiles (unlimited?).
	# an experiment will be a single tile that can popout and players can plant many crops
	# seeds from a single cross or seeds from different crosses can be planted
	# notes can be tracked for the cross
	# an experiment can only plant so many seeds (maybe can be upgraded for a price?)
